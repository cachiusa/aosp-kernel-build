# What's this?
AOSP created `build.sh` for their kernels but [deprecated them in Android 13](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/build/+/670b2ff547c0739352a200422e4e8a7149145947), replacing it with [kleaf](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/build/+/refs/heads/main/kleaf/README.md)  
This project aims to maintain `build.sh` and its friends
